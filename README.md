## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Our project offers several unique features that enhance the user experience. First, we have placed a search bar where you can use two models from left to right or vice versa. This feature allows users to enter their search queries in a way that is most convenient for them, taking into account different typing habits and preferences.

In terms of development, our project uses jQuery, HTML and CSS. jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies complex functions and enables dynamic content manipulation. HTML forms the backbone of our web content and provides the structure and elements of our project. CSS takes care of the visual presentation and enables us to customize the look and feel of our project.

One of the outstanding features of our project is that it opens in full screen mode. As soon as users access our project, it will be maximized to take up the entire screen space. This immersive experience removes distractions from other apps or browser elements, making it ideal for focused interaction. This full screen opening is especially useful for presentations, media galleries, or interactive applications that require the user's full attention.

Overall, our project combines the unique functionality of the search bar using jQuery, HTML and CSS, while offering an immersive full-page layout. These features work together to create a seamless and engaging user experience.
